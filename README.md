# Deep Learning
This contains some of the models implementations with either common datasets or
dummy ones. We intend to show the application and make it wide open for use.

# Computer Vision
The applications and code repo for some cool stuff. It's not limited to OpenCV.
We'll also be covering theory in the README.md (to-do).

# Neural-Networks using P5 JS
Inspired by Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code Tutorials. This is our work on it. 

**Repo referenced :** http://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples-p5.js

**Points to be noted:**

1) This work is more than just inspired by Daniel. He has made significant contributions to the Open Source Society and Processing Foundation. All credits to Daniel. 

2) The code might just completely match OR "not match" (if we plan to do some changes, significant we mean.) 

3) It's not for someone's learning as of now. It's an open sourced work of us, which we intend to do on week-ends (the week days work are in other repos, mainly of Computer Vision and Deep Learning). 

4) For ease, we'll put the things we've changed in a log file in the specific folder. **File name : changelog.txt** (To be added)
